It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I\\'m a crotchety old man, I\\'m a woman in my 20s, so I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m this movie\\'s target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid\\'s movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 0}), Document(page_content=': 1\\nReview_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: imseeg\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: 3 reasons FOR seeing it and 1 reason AGAINST.\\nReview: The first reason to go see it:\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 1}), Document(page_content=': 2\\nReview_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: Natcat87\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Too heavy handed\\nReview: As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the \"stereotypical Barbie\" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain\\'t the way to get it.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 2}), Document(page_content=': 3\\nReview_Date: 31 July 2023\\nAuthor: ramair350\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: As a guy I felt some discomfort, and that\\'s ok.\\nReview: As much as it pains me to give a movie called \"Barbie\" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I\\'m a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don\\'t agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that\\'s ok. This movie wasn\\'t designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were \"allowed\" to have \"real jobs\" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I\\'ll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 3}), Document(page_content=': 4\\nReview_Date: 24 July 2023\\nAuthor: heatherhilgers\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: A Technicolor Dream\\nReview: Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 4}), Document(page_content=\": 5\\nReview_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: G-Joshua-Benjamin\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: My mom and I saw this yesterday.

The ending made me feel sad and empty. Ken and Barbie don't end up together and they made Ken seem like a complete idiot. Actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie. And I'm not a man but that's just not true. It was depressing and sad and never the way Barbie was created for. I know a lot of people won't agree with me and that's okay but it was just pointless going to see it. The only good thing is that the Barbie aesthetic was beautifully done.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 8}), Document(page_content=\": 9\\nReview_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: hamsterination\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: It could have been so much better...\\nReview: The film's universe and settings are fantastic.

BARBIE kind of succeeds there: I loved the costuming and sets of Barbieland, and Margot Robie is such a fantastic actress, the perfect embodiment of the optimistic, she-can-do-it-all Barbie. Ryan Gosling was a scene-stealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coat.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 12}), Document(page_content=': 13\\nReview_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: jpismyname\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: Fun and surprisingly touching\\nReview: I was honestly doubting this movie at first, but surprisingly I find myself really liking it quite a lot.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 13}), Document(page_content=\": 14\\nReview_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: finnconnelly-63017\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Ken out of ten\\nReview: Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 14}), Document(page_content=\": 15\\nReview_Date: 23 July 2023\\nAuthor: Revuer223\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.\\nReview: The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 15}), Document(page_content=\": 16\\nReview_Date: 29 July 2023\\nAuthor: cmdown-50506\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: Now I am become Barbie Girl, the enjoyer of Barbie worlds\\nReview: I have been waiting for this to release for so long and I finally got to watch it today.

However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 17}), Document(page_content=\": 18\\nReview_Date: 4 August 2023\\nAuthor: thePopcornExplorer\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: I don't see how it was preachy\\nReview: In this day and age with society overall becoming more and more polarized and our leaders around the world doing nothing to improve dialogue, it seems that people became broken records. Now everything in the movies and TV shows is perceived as preachy, not everything is a conspiracy, people need to consider that movies and TV shows at its core, and specially the good ones, are about sharing perspectives and allow the audience, if their minds are opened to it, to acknowledge all sides of the stories.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 18}), Document(page_content=\": 19\\nReview_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: tm-sheehan\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Didn't hit my pink spot\\nReview: My Review - Barbie\\nIn Cinemas now\\nMy Rating 6.5/10\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 19}), Document(page_content=': 20\\nReview_Date: 20 July 2023\\nAuthor: Genti25\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: You are Kenough\\nReview: This movie is so much fun.

For the next hour (and more) the movie just lived in negativity.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 30}), Document(page_content=': 31\\nReview_Date: 1 August 2023\\nAuthor: zkonedog\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: An Amazingly Perfect Blend Of Social Satire & Fun\\nReview: For a film like \"Barbie\" to succeed, every aspect had to come together perfectly. It needed to consummately balance satire with fun, the casting had to be spot-on, and the writing/directing required to pull off such a feat would need to be exquisite. Somewhat remarkably, that is exactly what writer/director Greta Gerwig pulls off here to create the best movie of summer 2023.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 31}), Document(page_content=\": 32\\nReview_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: arslanmanzoor123\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Quite disappointing\\nReview: Some friends freaking out that I went to see Barbie lol I mean I mentioned I went coz my sister insisted since ages. Anyway the movie was bad. These days, every other director and producer wants to convey messages about women rights and feminism through whatever platform possible and this movie was a perfect example of that with sheer cringe to convey all that. I wished I had gotten the ticket for Oppenheimer in the same timings as my sister's Barbie show. Other than that, the acting done by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was great so can't take that away from them. They did justice to their roles.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 32}), Document(page_content=': 33\\nReview_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: MaskedMinty\\nRating: 5\\nReview_Title: Preach Preach Preach\\nReview: Let me start by saying that I\\'m by no means a conservative or traditional woman. I believe that inequality for women still is rampant even in first world countries and that we go through many problems. But damn...this movie is so corporate and shallow. It\\'s clearly ordered and tailored by executives at Mattel to rebrand and sell more dolls. The movie starts well and has the potential of becoming something very good, but then it just goes downhill: the premise of the owner\\'s feeling being projected onto the doll was going to lead to a very nice build up about a person\\'s life journey and then Barbie and Ken go to the human world and cue in the speeches and preaching. This movie suffers from a bad case of showing and not telling, they keep repeating the same dialogues: patriarchy bad patriarchy bad patriarchy bad sexism sexism sexism, not even one time but MULTIPLE TIMES. These characters go into random rants like its a ted talk! The chemistry between the mother and daughter is absolutely nonexistent and their relationship is so cringe, You cant root for them or feel their feelings at all. Barbie should have understood how Kens had been feeling in the Barbieland the whole time which is a mimic of how many women are still treated in the society: just existing for the gaze of a woman (man). Yet what do they do? They manipulate them (with a super nonsense plan) and force them back to their original position while she gives him a half assed apology that could have been done better and end up to a more accurate point about equality. (I guess this is again meta and a reflection of how women are pitted against each other while people in charge benefit from that but its so badly done that it feels meh.)\\nI can imagine that in the boardroom they went through a discussion like this: People are going to think this is a feel good movie so we need to give them something deeper but also lets make it absurd and fast paced so that we can finish the plot quickly and also jump on the \"not taking itself serious\" bandwagon and also market these dolls again in the age of smartphone kids. The only reason this movie gets at 5 from me is the humor, which sometimes becomes very meta and creative and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have acted very well. Besides this, they could have just given us a simple feel good movie and I would have respected the creators more. Pass.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 33}), Document(page_content=': 34\\nReview_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: faeez_rizwan\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: Wildly Pink\\nReview: Barbie Movie Review\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 34}), Document(page_content=': 35\\nReview_Date: 4 August 2023\\nAuthor: evanston_dad\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: Smart and Winning\\nReview: My wife and I were two of the apparently 200,000 or so people who Barbenheimered Greta Gerwig\\'s and Chritopher Nolan\\'s hot topic movies on opening weekend. \"Oppenheimer\" was first, a boring slog of history in which a bunch of white men blathering at each other for three hours resulted in the creation of weapons that could wipe out humanity. \"Barbie\" came in the evening, a fresh breeze of humanity to clear away Nolan\\'s emotional constipation.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 35}), Document(page_content=': 36\\nReview_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: AvionPrince16\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Barbie land and reality\\nReview: Im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest. It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. I think people who played with Barbie dolls or just know the universe will be happy; they have a lot of references to the world and a lot of Barbie references to the dolls and the differents clothes and the impact of her in society. Some moments were also absurd ( the fight with all the Kens). Its good anyway.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 36}), Document(page_content=': 37\\nReview_Date: 23 July 2023\\nAuthor: eoinageary\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: I am Kenough\\nReview: So I went into the movie with little to no expectations and I was pleasantly impressed with the movie overall.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 37}), Document(page_content=': 38\\nReview_Date: 25 July 2023\\nAuthor: spika13\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Too overrated\\nReview: Its like watching at \"Truman\\'s show\" but all the set it\\'s pink color with a hint of extreme feminist ideas.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that what it is supposed to be? It's literally a movie about Barbie. Instead, it felt more like an agent of woke culture, and basically Mattel's (the company that produces Barbie dolls) way of capitalizing the emotional aspect of the cinephiles to make their business more popular and trendier. It continuously tried to portray the fact that Mattel is no more producing white barbie dolls, it is now producing dolls of all colors and races. Well, that is definitely a good thing, but making most of the movie focus on that aspect felt very boring and wrong. If they didn't quite make a movie that is fun and adventurous, why make the marketing events misleading? They could've just focused on the audience for whom it was made, rather than on the entire world through their absurdly irrelevant marketing events that made the world think that this movie is going to be all about fun and adventure. Sadly, it was not nearly as enjoyable as the misleading marketing made it seem.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 40}), Document(page_content=\": 41\\nReview_Date: 25 July 2023\\nAuthor: mr_bickle_the_pickle\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: Life in plastic, it's fantastic!\\nReview: It's an incredibly fun movie.

Ryan Gosling clearly was having a lot of fun with the role, but don't sleep on Michael Cera as Allan.

Again honest - I went there just for Margot Robbie (I'm a married 34 year old male, and margot is one of my top 3 favorite actrices of all time, and arguably the most talented one from my list). And for that part it was totally ok. But the movie absolutely doesn't deserve an imdb rating above 5.6. The plot itself was very simple. Absolutely nothing particularly special in it. So if it is in fact getting rated so high just because of Margot alone, then why do her other movies don't get rated that well and get that much attention? Honestly I really don't understand and I think this movie is way too overhyped for no reason. And I have no idea why... For other movies that get hyped like that I do see the reasons why they're getting so hyped. So the movie is not awful, but it's rather average, if you're not going there specifically for Margot then I am pretty sure there will be multiple movies at your local cinema at the time you're reading this, which are way more worth watching than this one...\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 63}), Document(page_content=': 64\\nReview_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: fernandoschiavi\\nRating: 5\\nReview_Title: \"Barbie\" is fun and visually beautiful, but unfortunately Barbie doll was dragged into the cultural war, used as a puppet by political militancy\\nReview: Despite the strong commercial tone, it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by Greta Gerwig, director known for dramatic comedies that capture the complexity of femininity in an original way - although, in this case, it is almost inevitable to fall into some clichés. The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. \"Barbie\" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the \"corporate\" issue. It won\\'t be strange if you catch yourself thinking \"how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?\" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 64}), Document(page_content=\": 65\\nReview_Date: 20 July 2023\\nAuthor: PedroPires90\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: A triumph\\nReview: I appreciated it but wasn't a huge fan of Greta Gerwig's first two films.

Important to remember because wow what a talented individual. Recent memory sees him leading roles that require a more stoic subdued approach, and it can be easy to miss his range. Barbie seeks to utilize all his acting muscles, and to a resounding success. He can sing, dance, act, and do comedy.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 67}), Document(page_content=': 68\\nReview_Date: 6 August 2023\\nAuthor: D4V1D2411\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: Fun enough to like it but easily to hate for its message\\nReview: : I feel confused about this movie, probably like a lot of people, on one hand I laughed as I hadnt with a movie in a long time and the vibe this movie has is just very appealing, but on the other hand while not being an anti-men movie and actually trying to have a deep message, it feels at some parts like a tantrum. The way it handles its feminist message is not the best, because while it tries to give a meaningful speach, it almost boarders with hate speach and ridiculization, I say almost, because a lot of this situations are just played by the laughs and when theyre not, while being bad, theyre not terrible. But this makes it sound like a bad movie, which barbie is not, at the end it manages to actually give a meaningfull speech about the wrong in the real world and takes some minutes to understand both sides. It is still not the best ending possible because it can be a little too ridiculous, when you have a movie thats like that all the time I dont think it matters all that much. And at the end of the day I took home with me the minutes of laughter this movie gave to me, an enjoying fun time that is worth watching.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 68}), Document(page_content=': 69\\nReview_Date: 3 August 2023\\nAuthor: DanLawson146\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Fun, but too on the nose at times\\nReview: POSITIVES:\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 69}), Document(page_content=\": 70\\nReview_Date: 7 August 2023\\nAuthor: misscattik\\nRating: \\nReview_Title: No questions just answers\\nReview: The title of the review practically sums it all up. With the highest potential in style, aesthetics, cast and concept, the movie fails spectacularly when it comes to the deliverance of it's main idea. And it's not feminism that bothers, surely not, it's the artistic language in which the idea is told - harsh, manipulative, abusive, straightforward and unkind. Instead of aspiring the audience to think and reflect, it shoves the manifestations down your throat, and in monologues that are generally painfully awkward to watch.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 70}), Document(page_content=\": 71\\nReview_Date: 5 August 2023\\nAuthor: sjw1029\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: The movie event of 2023 lives up to the hype\\nReview: Let me start by saying it makes me happy to see a movie that isn't from the MCU or a sequel doing so well at the box office. There is still originality out there. This movie was very funny - the scene with Ken and the doctor in LA made me laugh very hard. It's weird and inventive. It has amazing choreography. So many talented people worked on this. I didn't grow up with Barbies so I'm sure a lot of the jokes went over my head. But it didn't hurt the enjoyment. It even manages to land a sentimental note at the end. I can definitely see this being a movie people see over and over.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 71}), Document(page_content=\": 72\\nReview_Date: 20 July 2023\\nAuthor: FeastMode\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: I'll beach you off so hard\\nReview: I had no idea what to expect going into Barbie.

I went in thinking it was going to be similar to The Truman Show and I wished it had've taken some elements from it because it would've made it much more powerful if so. I'm not going to spoil the ending but I thought the writers just gave up. Overall for me it's a 6/10. Good film but that's all. Definitely could've been less preachy.

The message of female empowerment was fine, but didn't really speak to gender equality. Barbieland is the opposite of real world where Barbies are in control and kens are perceived as the mindless accessories. However, the ending just puts Barbies back on top and doesn't do much to equality which I hope is our goal. The movie itself was very sloppy and all finish with no build up. You could tell the writers had ideas of what they wanted to have happen but had zero clue how to get there. They wanted Ken to take the patriarchy back to Barbieland but this happens immediately and off screen despite the Kens being bumbling morons the entire movie. It's all payoff and no buildup. Good acting from a strong cast made this more fun to watch but when you start thinking a little deeper it didn't make much sense. I think this was a made for tik tok movie where there's 100 great scenes to throw up on the internet but not very cohesive when put together.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 81}), Document(page_content=': 82\\nReview_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: bankofmarquis\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: More Than Meets The Eye\\nReview: The Margot Robbie/Ryan Gosling curiosity BARBIE is a subversive film.

It is not anti-men, it does not portray men as \"stupid\". Take a moment to think about how women have been portrayed in movies over the last century - oh yes, just as Ken is here! The movie exaggerates this, yes. That is the point. To clearly (and humourously) highlight the inequalities when the roles are reversed.

I felt the movie fell short of not preaching to me and spreading a message of division rather than unity. Men and women cannot survive without each other but you'd never know it watching this movie. And me having my 13 year old daughter with me almost caused me to walk out of the theater. I kept on waiting for the writers to hit the direction of unity but it never came. After the movie my daughter brought up the message to me saying how she even noticed the weird agenda they're trying to push and said that is not a movie for the easily impressionable. Come to find out my daughter is better suited to take on the world that I thought she was. Proud day for me as a father.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 86}), Document(page_content=\": 87\\nReview_Date: 20 July 2023\\nAuthor: threenails10\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: It's really something different and that's a good thing\\nReview: It's really something different but some of it feels inspired by other films, I caught references to Fight Club, 2001 Space Odyssey, Lego Movie, and others I can't think of at the moment. But yeah, this was a special film. I don't think as many people will like it as it probably deserves. But I did love most of it. Sometimes the tones felt off at times but it's definitely recommended to see. The satire works great here and the production design, cinematography and acting (intentionally bad in a way on purpose in some spots to deliver the satire aspects) are all perfectly done here though overall. The music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the Lego movie in some ways. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are both pitch perfect here as well. Definitely recommend anyone to give it a chance. I wouldn't say this is a family movie but I think families with older kids would work perfectly for this. Not sure this will be in the Oscar race but it seems like it will at least for technical aspects and production designs.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 87}), Document(page_content=\": 88\\nReview_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: bm230199\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Heart-warming, serious and such an important movie for everyone to see!\\nReview: When I sat down to watch this film I assumed it would be some fun pink silly movie but it was not in the best possible way. It starts very much in that way but the second Barbie gets to the real world everything changes and the film makes so many important statements on sexism and the treatment of women. I thought it perfectly addressed the affect Barbie has had on the world and never shied away from it. This movie does not flinch away from the reality of the world or what damage ignorance can do (Ken). America Ferrera's speech is amazing and moved me so much as did Barbie's own found freedom. Robbie was an amazing Barbie and all the women shined in this movie...and Alan was pretty good too. It was everything you can want from a movie, sharp, whitty, moving, honest and progressive.

What I liked the most about this movie is that it was very doll-like, the food and drink were plastic and fake, the cars didn't have engines and just glided along the floor, and the actors were doll-like in their movements and how they interacted with their environment.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 104}), Document(page_content=\": 105\\nReview_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: trinculodino\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Witty, funny but severly sterotypical\\nReview: A good laugh of a film poking fun at Mattel, complicating the concept of Barbie while at the same time highligting the patriarchy and it's inherent incompatibility with human emancipation.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 105}), Document(page_content=\": 106\\nReview_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: michelle-kissler\\nRating: 5\\nReview_Title: Barbie, Swing and a Miss\\nReview: This film had the potential to become a cult classic with its strong cast, stunning costumes, and iconic character.

The director uses the toy conglomerate's vast archive and successful products as tools to create a rich and weird material. The movie is a clever send-up of Barbie dolls and their legacy, featuring light-hearted jokes that poke fun at Mattel, the doll's lore, and the contradictions of our sexist society. The director's storytelling is impressive, and the film's humor is both lighthearted and chuckle-worthy. Gerwig's Barbieland, created by Sarah Greenwood and Jacqueline Durran, is a pink fever dream with funky compositions by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, bubblegum anthems by Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, and Ice Spice. The film features plastic trees and identical two-story Barbie dream homes, with flying being the preferred mode of transportation. The production design and costuming are exceptional, showcasing Gerwig's passion for details and her ability to create a dreamlike world. Barbieland is a feminist utopia in which Barbies serve as presidents, Supreme Court members, doctors, physicists, Nobel prize winners, and cancer cures. The dolls are not structurally different from our world, but they are represented by political fantasy and decade-dependent what-ifs. Barbie has gone to space, could vote, and own property before many human women, and her appearance has changed to mirror society's beauty politics. The representational doll has become an extension of political fantasy, reflecting the beauty politics of society. Gerwig features a cast of Barbies, including Issa Rae, Emma Mackey, Alexandra Shipp, and Hari Nef. Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) is the protagonist, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed Barbie created by Ruth Handler. Her Ken counterpart, Ryan Gosling, is portrayed with humor and heart. They are a version of Eve and Adam, with their fall being dramatic. Barbie finds her perfect life hampered by existential thoughts and seeks answers from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a doll with a traumatic history. Stereotypical Barbie, with Ken, heads to real-world Los Angeles to find her little girl. The relationship between Barbies and their human owners is tenuously outlined, so it's best not to think too deeply about how it all works. Robbie's performance in Gerwig's Barbie highlights the tension between Barbie as an object and subject. Her expressive eyes and physical presence reveal the human world's forces, while her rigid presence in Barbieland suggests she's not less rigid in the real world. Despite the director's skill in capturing deeper themes, the film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest it ultimately serves a brand. The film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest the film serves as a brand. Gerwig's film Barbieland is a mix of fun and emotional depth, with a tension between keeping Barbie entertaining and blending her source material with previous projects. After a detour, Barbie returns home to find Ken's patriarchal knowledge has transformed Barbieland. The screenplay, by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, avoids familiarity and mockery, but the moments that aren't just funny are buried in important monologues, making the gestures feel politically hollow. The film's mandate is too ambitious, making it feel politically hollow.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 110}), Document(page_content=\": 111\\nReview_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: PK_71\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Well played.\\nReview: For me, Barbie came very, very close to an 8/10 rating.

This film is a treat for Barbie lovers because the way director has told the storyline by introducing a whole barbie world and their characters is interesting to watch. Specially MARGOT ROBBIE what and actress she is her looks, style, acting performances, dresses of barbie all are top notch. Margot Robbie is perfectly suited for this role because she is the only one carrying the whole movie throughout the end. From start to end the main highlight of the this film is Margot Robbie. I've only watched this film for her and she has proved that currently she is one of the best actress in Hollywood. When I talk about supporting cast RYAN GOSLING is the only one who has done justice to the character of Ken rest are just average. Story is the main disappointment of the film, Film starts on a good note with laughs and riot of chaos when Barbie enters into the real world but after a bit of time story get exaggerated and only focuses on the central character which is the drawback of the film and from that case movie doesn't get the chance to give space to the other important characters. Background score and songs are good that wil give you a fresh vibe while watching this film. All n all this movie is a treat for Barbie fans and rest of the audience may consider as an average content....\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 115}), Document(page_content=\": 116\\nReview_Date: 1 August 2023\\nAuthor: fredrikgunerius\\nRating: 5\\nReview_Title: A trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes\\nReview: The big summer blockbuster of 2023 is a wonderful visual spectacle with a great deal of creative physical comedy, centered in and around the universe of Barbie, Mattel's historic toy doll. Unfortunately, the film tries to be and do much more than what the filmmakers ultimately are able to control and reel in. That a movie about Barbie would be guilty of Americanization is no surprise, and in many ways more than befitting, but the Americanization here isn't just about the history of the toy itself and all its cultural impacts - Barbie also views everything through the eyes of Hollywood anno 2023 - which arguably is a very particular and perhaps not that representative outlook. Instead of utilizing the fine foundation laid in the film's first third, director and co-writer Greta Gervig (Lady Bird, Little Women) gets herself lost in a trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes, which will leave youths - and perhaps particularly Europeans - feeling confused and conflicted. The filmmakers' supposed toying with stereotypes ultimately becomes more of a playing into them, especially towards the end when Gerwig staggers along desperately looking for closure and something meaningful to say. Alas, Barbie has ended up as a rather sad symptom of our times, when it could have been the wonderfully funny piece of femininity-appraising escapism it started out as. There are nonetheless several highlights here, such as the delightfully absurd opening sequence (a fine nod to Kubrick's 2001), the initial introduction of Barbie and Ken's days in Barbieland, and - of course - their first encounter with the real world.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 116}), Document(page_content=': 117\\nReview_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: bjacob\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: There is an art-house movie under all that pink\\nReview: I tend to gravitate towards French cinema and the classics; the idea of watching a franchise movie about Barbie seemed mildly repellent at first.

One may say it is a story of strength, and finding the beauty in yourself. Others, may just not like it. I am in the middle of all of that. The movie was a little better than meh, but lacked in some aspects that it could have dealt with more. I think Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were good, but I really didn't like their characters (Mostly Ken) The musical numbers and camera work were amazing. But, by far three things stood out to me. One, the costumes design and sets. The directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it. My honorable mention is Rhea Perlman. I thought she was phenomenal. While anyone could play that role she really brought it. Finally, America Ferrara. Since her days on Ugly Betty, she has became a household name. But in this movie she was wonderful. I enjoyed Superstore quite a bit and wanted to see Barbie mainly for her character. Her speech was moving and she brought so much to her simple, yet relatable mom.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 119}), Document(page_content=\": 120\\nReview_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: mckai-89546\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: Best for Ryan Gosling Gives a really great performance acting\\nReview: I am a man but watched this movie it's awesome Margot Robbie very beautiful but i like the performance of Ryan Gosling a lot this movie It's full of imagination and it surprises me a lot.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 120}), Document(page_content=': 121\\nReview_Date: 3 August 2023\\nAuthor: PennyReviews\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Good Enough\\nReview: Barbie is a fun summery movie for all ages.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 121}), Document(page_content=\": 122\\nReview_Date: 30 July 2023\\nAuthor: walfordior\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: This is more than just a 'lighthearted comedy'\\nReview: Barbie is no longer just a toy; rather, this idea of 'Barbie' has evolved into one of the most famous and significant topics in the world at this moment in time.

The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

However, the messages of the movie were the problem.

It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids.

It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. I think people who played with Barbie dolls or just know the universe will be happy; they have a lot of references to the world and a lot of Barbie references to the dolls and the differents clothes and the impact of her in society.

They could've just focused on the audience for whom it was made, rather than on the entire world through their absurdly irrelevant marketing events that made the world think that this movie is going to be all about fun and adventure.

It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world.

Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok.

The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. \"Barbie\" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the \"corporate\" issue.

They wanted Ken to take the patriarchy back to Barbieland but this happens immediately and off screen despite the Kens being bumbling morons the entire movie. It's all payoff and no buildup.

The director uses the toy conglomerate's vast archive and successful products as tools to create a rich and weird material. The movie is a clever send-up of Barbie dolls and their legacy, featuring light-hearted jokes that poke fun at Mattel, the doll's lore, and the contradictions of our sexist society. The director's storytelling is impressive, and the film's humor is both lighthearted and chuckle-worthy. Gerwig's Barbieland, created by Sarah Greenwood and Jacqueline Durran, is a pink fever dream with funky compositions by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, bubblegum anthems by Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, and Ice Spice. The film features plastic trees and identical two-story Barbie dream homes, with flying being the preferred mode of transportation. The production design and costuming are exceptional, showcasing Gerwig's passion for details and her ability to create a dreamlike world. Barbieland is a feminist utopia in which Barbies serve as presidents, Supreme Court members, doctors, physicists, Nobel prize winners, and cancer cures. The dolls are not structurally different from our world, but they are represented by political fantasy and decade-dependent what-ifs. Barbie has gone to space, could vote, and own property before many human women, and her appearance has changed to mirror society's beauty politics. The representational doll has become an extension of political fantasy, reflecting the beauty politics of society. Gerwig features a cast of Barbies, including Issa Rae, Emma Mackey, Alexandra Shipp, and Hari Nef. Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) is the protagonist, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed Barbie created by Ruth Handler. Her Ken counterpart, Ryan Gosling, is portrayed with humor and heart. They are a version of Eve and Adam, with their fall being dramatic. Barbie finds her perfect life hampered by existential thoughts and seeks answers from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a doll with a traumatic history. Stereotypical Barbie, with Ken, heads to real-world Los Angeles to find her little girl. The relationship between Barbies and their human owners is tenuously outlined, so it's best not to think too deeply about how it all works. Robbie's performance in Gerwig's Barbie highlights the tension between Barbie as an object and subject. Her expressive eyes and physical presence reveal the human world's forces, while her rigid presence in Barbieland suggests she's not less rigid in the real world. Despite the director's skill in capturing deeper themes, the film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest it ultimately serves a brand. The film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest the film serves as a brand. Gerwig's film Barbieland is a mix of fun and emotional depth, with a tension between keeping Barbie entertaining and blending her source material with previous projects. After a detour, Barbie returns home to find Ken's patriarchal knowledge has transformed Barbieland. The screenplay, by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, avoids familiarity and mockery, but the moments that aren't just funny are buried in important monologues, making the gestures feel politically hollow. The film's mandate is too ambitious, making it feel politically hollow.\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 110}), Document(page_content='Review_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 110}), Document(page_content=\": 111\\nReview_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: PK_71\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Well played.\\nReview: For me, Barbie came very, very close to an 8/10 rating.

This film is a treat for Barbie lovers because the way director has told the storyline by introducing a whole barbie world and their characters is interesting to watch. Specially MARGOT ROBBIE what and actress she is her looks, style, acting performances, dresses of barbie all are top notch. Margot Robbie is perfectly suited for this role because she is the only one carrying the whole movie throughout the end. From start to end the main highlight of the this film is Margot Robbie. I've only watched this film for her and she has proved that currently she is one of the best actress in Hollywood. When I talk about supporting cast RYAN GOSLING is the only one who has done justice to the character of Ken rest are just average. Story is the main disappointment of the film, Film starts on a good note with laughs and riot of chaos when Barbie enters into the real world but after a bit of time story get exaggerated and only focuses on the central character which is the drawback of the film and from that case movie doesn't get the chance to give space to the other important characters. Background score and songs are good that wil give you a fresh vibe while watching this film.

Unfortunately, the film tries to be and do much more than what the filmmakers ultimately are able to control and reel in. That a movie about Barbie would be guilty of Americanization is no surprise, and in many ways more than befitting, but the Americanization here isn't just about the history of the toy itself and all its cultural impacts - Barbie also views everything through the eyes of Hollywood anno 2023 - which arguably is a very particular and perhaps not that representative outlook. Instead of utilizing the fine foundation laid in the film's first third, director and co-writer Greta Gervig (Lady Bird, Little Women) gets herself lost in a trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes, which will leave youths - and perhaps particularly Europeans - feeling confused and conflicted. The filmmakers' supposed toying with stereotypes ultimately becomes more of a playing into them, especially towards the end when Gerwig staggers along desperately looking for closure and something meaningful to say. Alas, Barbie has ended up as a rather sad symptom of our times, when it could have been the wonderfully funny piece of femininity-appraising escapism it started out as. There are nonetheless several highlights here, such as the delightfully absurd opening sequence (a fine nod to Kubrick's 2001), the initial introduction of Barbie and Ken's days in Barbieland, and - of course - their first encounter with the real world.\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 116}), Document(page_content='Review_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 116}), Document(page_content=': 117\\nReview_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: bjacob\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: There is an art-house movie under all that pink\\nReview: I tend to gravitate towards French cinema and the classics; the idea of watching a franchise movie about Barbie seemed mildly repellent at first.

I think Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were good, but I really didn't like their characters (Mostly Ken) The musical numbers and camera work were amazing. But, by far three things stood out to me. One, the costumes design and sets. The directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it. My honorable mention is Rhea Perlman. I thought she was phenomenal. While anyone could play that role she really brought it. Finally, America Ferrara. Since her days on Ugly Betty, she has became a household name. But in this movie she was wonderful.

From 2012 onwards, Mattel expanded the franchise beyond just the films to other audiovisual media such as web series, television shows and streaming television content, with the latter following the growing trend of streaming services and online platforms. In 2020, Mattel revamped the films into streaming television films, branding them as animated \"specials\" and integrating them into the canon of the inaugural television show in the Barbie media franchise, Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures.

It starts very much in that way but the second Barbie gets to the real world everything changes and the film makes so many important statements on sexism and the treatment of women. I thought it perfectly addressed the affect Barbie has had on the world and never shied away from it. This movie does not flinch away from the reality of the world or what damage ignorance can do (Ken). America Ferrera's speech is amazing and moved me so much as did Barbie's own found freedom. Robbie was an amazing Barbie and all the women shined in this movie...and Alan was pretty good too. It was everything you can want from a movie, sharp, whitty, moving, honest and progressive. The perfect Barbie.\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 88}), Document(page_content='\\nReview: Im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest. It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements.

I think people who played with Barbie dolls or just know the universe will be happy; they have a lot of references to the world and a lot of Barbie references to the dolls and the differents clothes and the impact of her in society.
